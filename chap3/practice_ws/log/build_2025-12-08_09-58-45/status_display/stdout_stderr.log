[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (target_link_libraries):
  Target "sys_status_display" links to:

    Qt5::Widgets

  but the target was not found.  Possible reasons include:

    * There is a typo in the target name.
    * A find_package call is missing for an IMPORTED target.
    * An ALIAS target is missing.
